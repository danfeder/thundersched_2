# CLAUDE.md - Cooking Class Scheduler Assistant

## Project Overview
This project is a manual cooking class scheduler that helps users schedule cooking classes for 33 elementary school classes while respecting schedule constraints.

## Commands
- No specific build/lint/test commands have been defined yet
- The project appears to be in planning phase with only documentation

## Data Files
- `ClassesAndConflicts.csv`: Contains class conflict data (periods when classes cannot be scheduled)

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Framework**: To be decided
- **Frontend**: Focus on responsive UI with clear visual feedback
- **Naming**: Use descriptive names for classes, functions, and variables
- **Error Handling**: Implement client-side validation with real-time feedback
- **UI**: Implement drag-and-drop interface with color-coded visualization
- **Data Structure**: 
  - Class data: name, grade level, conflict periods
  - Schedule: 8 periods per day, 5 days per week (Monday-Friday)
  - Teaching load: 3-4 classes per day, 12-16 classes per week

## Implementation Priorities
1. Core manual scheduling interface
2. Enhanced assistance features
3. Optimization features (future)
